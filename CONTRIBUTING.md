# Contribution Guidelines

Please note that the Battlesnake community abides by a [Code of Conduct](https://docs.battlesnake.com/policies/conduct).

By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

---

Please make a best effort to ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Resources directly relate to the game of [Battlesnake](https://play.battlesnake.com/) and its community
- Resources are either open source or free to use, read, watch, or otherwise consume
- Resources are in alphabetical order within a section, for fairness and easy reference
- Additions and edits are kept consistent with the existing formatting and structure of the document
- Links to external resources are publically accessible (no broken URLs, no paywalls, no password requirements)

If the resource is intended to be publically accessible, but technically
requires a password to use, it will be allowed as long as the login credentials
are declared. In that case we ask that if the password ever changes, you would
open a new PR to update the login instructions or remove the URL.

If the resources you are adding does not fit the existing sections or
categories, please place it under "Miscellaneous". The project maintainers will
decide how to organize it and whether to add a new section, but feel free to
suggest a topic or category that is relevant to your PR.

Contributing your own resource (a "shameless plug") is allowed and encouraged.

Thank you for your suggestions!


## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we may ask you to
edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit
the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.

Project maintainers may also take the liberty of making their own edits before
merging your PR. If you make a best effort to follow the contributing
guidelines, we will do what we can to make the process easier in return.
